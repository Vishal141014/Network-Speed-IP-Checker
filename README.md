# Network Speed & IP Checker

A modern web application to check your network speed and IP address information.

![Network Speed & IP Checker](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Network+Speed+%26+IP+Checker)

## Features

- **IP Information**: Displays your public IP address and location details using the ipapi.co API
- **Download Speed Test**: Measures how fast your connection can download data
- **Upload Speed Test**: Measures how fast your connection can upload data
- **Ping/Latency Test**: Measures the response time of your connection

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: AOS.js (Animate On Scroll), LottieFiles
- **Backend** (Optional): Node.js with Express.js
- **API**: ipapi.co for IP information

```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Frontend Only)

You can use the application without setting up the backend server:

1. Simply open the `frontend/index.html` file in your browser
2. The app will use client-side methods for speed testing
3. IP detection will work normally using the ipapi.co API

### With Backend Server (More Accurate Speed Tests)

If you want more accurate speed tests:

1. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Deployment on Vercel

This application is configured for easy deployment on Vercel:

### Prerequisites

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you don't have one
2. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

### Deploy Using Vercel CLI

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Log in to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```
3. Deploy the project:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
4. Follow the prompts and your app will be deployed!

### Deploy Using Vercel GitHub Integration

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Keep the default settings (Vercel will automatically detect the configuration)
6. Click "Deploy"

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel dashboard, select your project
2. Go to "Settings" > "Domains"
3. Add your domain and follow the instructions

## How It Works

- **IP Information**: The application uses the ipapi.co API to fetch your public IP address and related information like location, ISP, and more.

- **Download Speed**: The test measures how quickly your connection can download data. In frontend-only mode, it samples a portion of a file from a public CDN. When using the backend, it downloads a random file generated by the server.

- **Upload Speed**: Similar to the download test, this measures how quickly your connection can upload data. In frontend-only mode, it uses httpbin.org. With the backend, it measures upload to the local server.

- **Ping/Latency**: This measures the round-trip time for a request to reach a server and return.

## Troubleshooting

### Animations Not Loading

If the Lottie animations don't load:
- The application will automatically fall back to SVG icons
- No action needed, this fallback is built into the app

### Speed Test Issues

If the speed test doesn't work:
- Make sure you have an active internet connection
- In frontend-only mode, some firewalls may block the test
- If using the backend, make sure the server is running
